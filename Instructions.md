 Web Dev Project - Left Right Center Dice Game

 ## How To Play
 The game cannot be started with less than 3 players. Each player starts with 
 three credits by default. The player that initiates the lobby will be player 1 
 and will start the game off. Each person will take turns rolling a set number
 of dice that will never exceed 3 and will only drop below if the player drops 
 below 3 credits. If the player has 2 credits, then 2 die will be rolled. If
 the player has 1 credit, then 1 die will be rolled. If the player does not have
 any credits, you are not out of the game yet, but you may not roll any die. 
 The game will end when the last person with credits rolls all dots on the die.
